_If you want to add any optimization or spot a bug, feel free to raise a pull request. \
If for any solutions you can add 2-3 lines on the top of the file about the solutions, especially for the somewhat harder ones, that'd be great.
If you can make this readme nicer (but mainly more useful), welcome to raise PR for that too._
